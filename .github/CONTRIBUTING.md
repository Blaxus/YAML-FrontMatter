## How to contribute

We prefer a minimalism approach. The [MicroPHP Manifesto](http://microphp.org) says it best. But in short:

> I want to write and manage less code.

We aim for simplicity and ease of use. Not cluttering and endless dependencies. By contributing you recognize our standards. And try to adhere to them.

### Semantic Versioning

We adhere to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org). So when it come down to Releases it is important to understand the differences and changes that you make.

### Documentation

Making code changes is not the only contribution you can make. If you did, it is also nice to update the documentation.

You may also clean-up and update the Documentation if necessary.

### Core Development Discussion

Contact the core Maintainer(s) [@blaxus](https://github.com/blaxus) if you want to become a maintainer/support, have feature requests or other questions.
